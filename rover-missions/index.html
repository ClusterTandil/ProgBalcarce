                        <p><strong>To support an integrated program structure, MEP carries out a number of

                                The Mars Data and Analysis Program (MDAP) is a scientific research and
                                analysis effort that sponsors detailed studies of data returned from

                                future-mission studies. Research conducted through MDAP is intended to

                                The Program Formulation Office conducts advanced studies of future
                                missions. MEP sets priorities for these studies through informal
                                (e.g., MEPAG) and formal channels (e.g., the National Academies’ Solar
                                System Decadal Surveys). Studies and planning for these missions, as
                                well as identification of technology needs and investments to meet
                                them, are the focus of long-range program planning and targeted
                                technology investments. Advanced studies also address possible needs
                                to replenish Mars telecommunication capabilities and other
                                programmatic support (e.g., landing site certification) that may be
                                needed to support future missions. Orbiters with these required
                                capabilities and/or other priorities such as sample return flight
                                elements may also provide opportunities to address science objectives.
                                Missions that address other Agency objectives (e.g., preparations for
                                the future human exploration of the martian system) are considered
                                jointly with key stakeholders from other parts of the Agency. An
                                additional responsibility for the Program Formulation Office is
                                definition of interfaces between ongoing missions or missions in
                                development, and future missions that have not yet begun development.
                                This activity is especially important where Program objectives require
                                coordination across multiple projects (e.g., the case of multiple
                                missions cooperating on the return of samples from the surface of
                                Mars).

                                The MEP supports the implementation of large and small directed
                                missions as well as those that are competitively selected and led by a
                                PI. These missions have included the Phoenix mission, which landed in
                                the northern polar region of Mars to study ice, and the MAVEN mission,
                                which is quantifying the rate of escape of atmospheric gases from the
                                planet and implications for the ancient martian climate.

                        <p>In 1994, NASA announced the start of the Mars Exploration Program (MEP),
                            initially called the Mars Surveyor Program. NASA assigned the lead role
                            for MEP implementation to the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL). MEP
                            explores Mars on behalf of NASA’s Science Mission Directorate (SMD). MEP
                            currently operates rovers and orbiters on and around Mars, contributes
                            to Mars missions conducted by national and international partners, and
                            is formulating and developing future rover and orbiter missions.
                            Scientific data and associated information for all MEP missions are
                            archived in the NASA Planetary Data System.</p>

                                Scientific discoveries by one mission can drive the formulation of the
                                scientific focus of future missions. Acquired data provides crucial
                                information for the execution of future missions. For example, orbiter
                                missions provide data for characterizing and certifying candidate
                                landing sites for future missions, while landed assets provide ground
                                truth and detailed context for orbital remote-sensing results.
                                Scientific observations from landed assets are interpreted and placed
                                into a broader context using research results from other areas of the
                                planet, which help inform our understanding of Mars as a system.

                            <strong>There are several strategic, practical and scientific reasons for humans
                                to explore Mars.</strong> Among them we know that Mars is the most accessible
                            place in the solar system. Additionally, exploring Mars provides the
                            opportunity to possibly answer origin and evolution of life questions,
                            and could someday be a destination for survival of humankind.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            In the strategic sense, exploring Mars demonstrates our political and
                            economic leadership as a nation, improves the quality of life on Earth,
                            helps us learn about our home planet, and expands US leadership in the
                            peaceful, international exploration of space.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            From a practical perspective we know that Mars is unique across the
                            entire solar system in that it is a terrestrial planet with an
                            atmosphere and climate, its geology is known to be very diverse and
                            complex (like Earth), and it appears that the climate of Mars has
                            changed over its history (like Earth).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Overall, many of the key questions in solar system science can be
                            addressed effectively by exploring Mars. This endeavor also serves to
                            inspire the next generation of explorers and dramatically expand human
                            knowledge.

                            programs. Scientists from all over the United States (university
                            professors, NASA center researchers, etc.) submit research grant
                            proposals to these programs. The proposals are peer reviewed and

                            (MDAP). The goal of MDAP is to enhance the scientific return of data
                            collected during Mars missions. Data used in the program must be
                            publicly available 30 days before the proposal submission deadline.
                            Currently there are 108 active grants and 10 active NASA Earth and Space
                            Science Fellowships (NESSF) for graduate students.

                                searching for suitable locations for humans to land.</strong> The agency is

                            resources to allow human explorers to land, live, and work on Mars.
                            Locally derived natural resources such as water and oxygen are crucial
                            for humans to explore Mars. (More about exploration zones.)

                            Liquid water could be potentially be extracted from ground ice (at or
                            buried beneath the surface), the atmosphere or hydrated minerals. Oxygen
                            can be generated from the carbon dioxide that makes up most of Mars'
                            atmosphere. The Mars 2020 rover mission will include an instrument
                            (MOXIE) to demonstrate the technology for oxygen generation.

                                that could survive the trip to Mars and its harsh surface environments
                                before being launched back into space. Hybrid rocket motors using

                                Control (LITVC). Using small ports to inject liquid oxidizer directly
                                into the nozzle at different points, the direction of the MAV can be
                                controlled quickly and effectively with no moving parts, even in the
